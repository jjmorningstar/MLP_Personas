### Case Number Convention

Per `core/case-format.md`: `YYYY-CATC-NNN-DDD`. CATC = category (ARCH, INFRA, DEL, CONT, SEC, EXEC, FEAT, BUG, MAINT, DOC). NNN = matter sequence; DDD = deliberation sequence within matter.

---

## Special Interest Hearing Template

Use when the court convenes an **investigative hearing**—testimony collection and examination with no final vote. Purpose: revelation, not resolution.

**Invocation:** User or Judge requests a Special Interest Hearing on a matter requiring investigation (incidents, conflicting accounts, root cause analysis).

**Full template:** [`templates/special-interest-hearing.md`](special-interest-hearing.md)

### Proceeding Types (Courtroom Quiver)

| Type | Purpose | Outcome | Transcript |
|------|---------|---------|------------|
| **Standard Deliberation** | Reach a decision | Vote + ruling | `YYYY-MM-DD-[slug].md` |
