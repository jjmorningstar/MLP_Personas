## [2026-02-19] - Executive Branch Implementation (Case 2026-EXEC-001)

### Court Ruling 2026-DEL-001 (4-1-0)

The court approved the addition of an **Executive Branch** with five conditions: (1) clear separation of concerns between judicial and executive functions, (2) immutable logging of all judicial decisions, (3) cryptographic proof required for executive overrides, (4) watchdog process for oversight, (5) distributed consensus protocol for critical decisions.

**Transcript:** `litigation/transcripts/2026-02-19-the-addition-of-an-executive-branch-into-the-larger-architec.md`

## [2026-02-17] - Agent Skills Index and Skills per Agent

### Full Session 2026-DEL-004 (5-0-0)

Convened a full session to debate and adopt **what skills to add to each agent** in `.cursor/agents/` (morningstar, octavius, aegis-protocol, lil-jeff). Court adopted a **single skills index** at `docs/agent-skills.md` as source of truth, with skill name, source path, when to use, and fallback per agent. Each agent file (in both `.cursor/agents/` and `agents/`) now has a **Skills** section pointing to the index.

**Transcript:** `courtroom/transcripts/2026-02-17-full-session-skills-to-add-to-each-agent.md`

**Slate:** morningstar (state, transcript, checklists, litigation runner, create-rule/skill); octavius (executive summary, checklist, Quarto compliance); aegis-protocol (escalation to MORNINGSTAR, chaos injection note); lil-jeff (handoff protocol, no placeholders, create-rule).

---

## [2026-02-17] - Domain Expert Registry Expansion (15 Domains)

### Bench Trial 2026-DEL-003 (6-1-0, Judge 2×)

Convened a full bench trial to adopt the **15 most important expert domains** to add to the court's repertoire. Judge's vote counted as 2× the average of other members. Full gallery; witnesses (Compliance, Security, Performance, Accessibility) testified.

**Transcript:** `courtroom/transcripts/2026-02-17-bench-trial-fifteen-experts-to-add-to-repertoire.md`

**15 domains added to `courtroom/domains/experts.yaml`:** data_privacy, observability, resilience, incident_response, devops, documentation, design_systems, frontend, mobile, ai_ml, data_engineering, cost, sustainability, ethics, qa_automation. All witness + specialist. Registry version 2.0; next review 2026-05-18.

**References updated:** courtroom/domains/README.md, courtroom/RULES.md § 6.3, agents/morningstar.md, .cursor/agents/morningstar.md, README.md, litigation/README.md, litigation/prompts/README.md, wiki/Command-Reference.md, wiki/Domains-and-Experts.md.

## [2026-02-16] - Contempt & Prosecution Hearing: The People vs. Elon Musk (Xenon Fraud)

### Special Interest Hearing (MORNINGSTAR)

Convened a Contempt & Prosecution Hearing in Special Interest format for *The People vs. Elon Musk (regarding the Xenon Fraud)*. Investigative proceeding (no vote); purpose: establish factual record surrounding the Xenon approach failure and alleged investor fraud; contempt of the court of public opinion and investor trust.

**Transcript:** `courtroom/transcripts/20260216_160000_special_interest_xenon_fraud_elon_musk.md`

**Witnesses (3):** Forensic Accountant (fraud / disclosure), Xenon Engineer (technical impossibility of Xenon approach), Elon Musk (hostile witness; first principles / species-level justification).

**Personalities:** ARCHITECT (structural lies), ENGINEER (technical failure), DEBUGGER (edge cases / fraud unraveling), PROPHET (vision vs execution), COUNSEL (innovation-risk mitigation).

**Spectators:** Dr. Echo Sageseeker (Great Man / psychohistory), Dr. Harley Scarlet Quinn (satirical grift), Uncle Ruckus (technical reality). Edward Cullen invoked (what Musk isn't saying).

**Findings (5):** Xenon failure material and undisclosed; post-failure representations of continuity; structural design of communications was to maintain false narrative; respondent's justification (first principles / species-level); mitigating narrative (intent to preserve) noted without negating findings.

---

## [2026-02-16] - Special Inquiry Hearing: Bohemian Grove

### Special Inquiry (MORNINGSTAR)

Convened an extensive Special Inquiry Hearing into the Bohemian Grove—a private 2,700-acre retreat owned by the Bohemian Club in Northern California. Investigative proceeding (no vote); purpose: establish factual record.

**Transcript:** `courtroom/transcripts/20260216_120000_special_inquiry_bohemian_grove.md`

**Witnesses (9):** Professor Ashworth (history), Dr. Voss (sociology), Mr. Chenoweth (former staff), Dr. Marsh (ritual studies), Senator Hargrove (political activity), Ms. Torres (journalism), Mr. Whitfield (club defense), Dr. Webb (power structure), Professor Vance (constitutional law).

**Findings (6):** Evolution from artistic to elite membership; documented political activity despite motto; Cremation of Care as published theatrical ritual; secrecy through rules and isolation; unresolved tension between "no business" policy and networking; legal protections limit transparency.

**Spectators:** Dr. Echo Sageseeker, Dr. Harley Scarlet Quinn, Uncle Ruckus. Edward Cullen invoked.

---

## [2026-02-16] - Special Interest Hearing: Internal Security (Aegis-Integrated)

### Special Interest Hearing (MORNINGSTAR + AEGIS PROTOCOL)

Convened an internal security hearing assessing secret leakage risk, operational sensitivity of transcripts/state/agents, portal export surfaces, prompt-injection hazards, and supply-chain volatility. Investigative proceeding (no vote); purpose: establish record + recommendations.

**Transcript:** `courtroom/transcripts/20260216_133000_special_interest_internal_security_aegis.md`

**Aegis:** Full Sage/Watcher/Chronicler Authority Assessment included (with Black Swan chaos injection stress-test).

**Findings (5):** No working-tree secrets detected by common patterns; sensitive operational artifacts exist by design; tracked `portal/exports/` weakens containment boundary; exporter path is plausible untrusted-input→HTML vector; dominant risk is process/tooling gates rather than current detected secrets.

---

## [2026-02-15] - Experts/Domains Integration & Root README Overhaul

### Experts and domains integration

- **`core/sme-framework.md`** — Added canonical registry reference: authoritative domain list and metadata in `courtroom/domains/experts.yaml`, usage and summoning in `courtroom/domains/README.md`.
- **Root `README.md`** — Experts/domains fully integrated:
  - Navigation Index: links to `courtroom/domains/README.md` and `courtroom/domains/experts.yaml`.
  - Command Reference: Available SME Domains now point to canonical registry and list all domains (including `cryptography`, `api_design`, `testing`).
  - New **Domains & Experts** section: purpose, table of locations, domain list, link to `core/sme-framework.md`.
  - Project Structure: `courtroom/domains/` with README and experts.yaml listed.

---

## [2026-02-15] - Portal Launch and Export Fixes

### Portal: seamless launch and excellence

- **`portal/export_transcript.py`** (new) — Exports a single transcript `.md` to styled HTML. No external dependencies (stdlib only). Used by the launch script when no pre-built `.html` exists. Supports Dracula theme and personality/vote styling.
- **`portal/launch.sh`** — No longer depends on missing `tools/cli.py`. Now:
  - Prefers existing `.html` in `courtroom/transcripts/` (opens directly).
  - Otherwise runs `python3 portal/export_transcript.py` to export, then opens the result.
  - Supports both transcript filename formats: `YYYY-MM-DD-topic.md` and `YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS_topic.md`.
- **`portal/viewer.html`** — `KNOWN_TRANSCRIPTS` updated to the real transcript; `extractDate` and `extractTitle` support `YYYY-MM-DD-topic` filenames.
- **`portal/generate.py`** — Transcript index generation now recognizes `YYYY-MM-DD-topic` as well as `YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS_topic`.
- **`portal/README.md`** — Aligned with actual behavior: launch script as primary entry point, export script documented, filename formats and troubleshooting updated.
- **Project `README.md`** — Portal added to Navigation Index and Project Structure; new step "View Transcripts in Browser" (run `./portal/launch.sh`).

Portal use case is now suited to the repo and launches seamlessly via `./portal/launch.sh`.

---

## [2026-02-15] - Framework Enhancement Analysis

### Decisions

- **Case 2026-INFRA-001: Framework Enhancement Analysis** — Adopted 10 enhancements to improve MORNINGSTAR infrastructure operability. Vote: 4-0-0 (Unanimous). Risk: Temporary inconsistency during implementation.

### The Ten Enhancements (Ratified)

| # | Enhancement | File | Priority |
|---|-------------|------|----------|
| 1 | Enhanced README with Navigation Index | `README.md` | HIGH |
| 2 | Personality Definitions File | `core/personalities.md` | HIGH |
| 3 | Precedent Database Schema | `courtroom/precedents.md` | MEDIUM |
| 4 | Inter-Agent Protocol | `core/inter-agent-protocol.md` | HIGH |
| 5 | Session Templates Directory | `templates/*.md` | MEDIUM |
| 6 | Command Quick-Reference | `README.md` section | HIGH |
| 7 | Metrics Dashboard | `state/metrics.md` | MEDIUM |
| 8 | State Validation Schema | `core/state-schema.md` | MEDIUM |
| 9 | Transcript Integrity Requirements | `courtroom/RULES.md` addition | MEDIUM |
| 10 | Error Recovery & Rollback Protocol | `core/error-recovery.md` | HIGH |

### Prophet Proposals Deferred

- P1: Living Persona Library — Requires operational experience
- P2: Deliberation Replay System — Needs transcripts to exist first
- P3: Prophetic Pattern Recognition — Awaits metrics infrastructure
- P4: Cross-Framework Integration — Depends on inter-agent protocol

### Consultant's Observation

Edward Cullen noted: *"The framework assumes good-faith operators. The system trusts. Perhaps that is its greatest vulnerability—and its greatest strength."*
