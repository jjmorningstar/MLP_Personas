## Pending Matters

### Queued Deliberations
<!-- Issues awaiting formal court review -->

*None pending.*

### Open Questions
<!-- Unresolved questions that may require deliberation -->

- Git history secret scan has not been performed (working tree only).
- `portal/export_transcript.py` does not globally escape transcript HTML (risk if transcripts become untrusted input).
- `portal/exports/` contains tracked `.html` exports despite ignore intent; publication boundary unclear.

### Blocked Items
<!-- Work items waiting on external dependencies -->

| Item | Blocked By | Since |
|------|------------|-------|
| - | - | - |

## Session Memory

### Key Context
<!-- Critical information the court must remember across interactions -->

- Xenon Fraud Hearing (2026-CONT-002): Special Interest Hearing held for *The People vs. Elon Musk*; 3 witnesses (Forensic Accountant, Xenon Engineer, Elon Musk hostile); 5 findings; Edward Cullen invoked (unspoken: need to be right over honest). Transcript: `courtroom/transcripts/20260216_160000_special_interest_xenon_fraud_elon_musk.md`.
- Security posture (2026-SEC-001): No working-tree secrets detected by common patterns; primary risks are process-driven (future accidental inclusion), historical (git history), and portal export surface (untrusted input → HTML). Transcript filed: `courtroom/transcripts/20260216_133000_special_interest_internal_security_aegis.md`.
- Aegis Protocol (2026-ARCH-002): 15 enhancements adopted; handoff to LIL_JEFF. See HANDOFF-2026-ARCH-002.md.
- Agent structure (2026-ARCH-001): Optional frontmatter adopted; implementation complete.
- Second slate (2026-INFRA-002): 10 enhancements adopted unanimously; handoff to LIL_JEFF and OCTAVIUS
- Edward: favor reducing operator memory load over adding features
- First slate (2026-INFRA-001) implemented; framework operational
- Prophet proposals P1, P2, P4 deferred; P5 (Dissolution) adopted in second slate
- Inter-agent protocol to be extended for OCTAVIUS handoff

### Assumptions in Effect
<!-- Current working assumptions that may need revisiting -->

- Framework documentation is complete and consistent
- Users can navigate and operate using the new structure

### Technical Debt Acknowledged
<!-- Debt accepted during this session, to be addressed later -->

| Debt | Accepted | Reason | Priority |
|------|----------|--------|----------|
| Portal exporter does not globally escape/sanitize transcript HTML | 2026-02-16 | Export path assumes trusted input; risk if transcripts become untrusted | HIGH |
| Tracked files in `portal/exports/` despite ignore intent | 2026-02-16 | Shareable exports increase leak probability | HIGH |
| Git history secret scan not automated | 2026-02-16 | Working tree scan insufficient | MEDIUM |
| Missing SME failures file | 2026-02-15 | Referenced but never created | MEDIUM |
| Deferred Prophet proposals (P1, P2, P4) | 2026-02-15 | Premature without operational experience | LOW |

## Notes

<!-- Freeform notes for the Scribe to reference -->

First formal deliberation of the MORNINGSTAR framework. Unanimous ratification of enhancement slate. Edward's observation regarding operator trust should be revisited when considering security enhancements.

**Implementation complete (2026-02-15):** LIL_JEFF implemented all 10 enhancements:
1. README.md — Enhanced with navigation index and command reference
2. core/personalities.md — Complete personality definitions
3. core/state-schema.md — State validation rules
4. templates/session-start.md — Session templates
5. courtroom/RULES.md — Transcript integrity requirements added
6. core/error-recovery.md — Recovery and rollback protocols
7. courtroom/precedents.md — Precedent database with first entry
8. state/metrics.md — Metrics dashboard
9. core/inter-agent-protocol.md — MORNINGSTAR ↔ LIL_JEFF protocol

The framework is now fully operational with comprehensive documentation.

**Second deliberation (2026-02-15):** Case 2026-INFRA-002. Court adopted second slate of 10 enhancements (SME failures, Dissolution Protocol, glossary, precedent citation, OCTAVIUS handoff, onboarding, portal discovery, state backup, runbook, edge-case registry). Handoff: LIL_JEFF primary, OCTAVIUS where applicable. See courtroom/transcripts/HANDOFF-2026-INFRA-002.md.

**Agent structure deliberation (2026-02-15):** Case 2026-ARCH-001. Court adopted CrewAI-inspired optional agent frontmatter (role, goal, backstory, allow_delegation, response_format). Investigation: docs/agent-structure-investigation.md. Transcript: courtroom/transcripts/2026-02-15-agent-structure-deliberation.md. Handoff to LIL_JEFF: courtroom/transcripts/HANDOFF-2026-ARCH-001.md.
