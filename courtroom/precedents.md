### 2026-INFRA-001-001: Framework Enhancement Analysis

**Date:** 2026-02-15  
**Feasibility:** F4 (Critical)  
**Vote:** 4-0-0 (Unanimous)  
**Status:** BINDING  
**Tags:** #infrastructure #process #approved  
**Transcript:** [courtroom/transcripts/2026-02-15-framework-enhancement-analysis.md](transcripts/2026-02-15-framework-enhancement-analysis.md)

#### Matter

The court conducted a comprehensive analysis of the MORNINGSTAR framework infrastructure to identify the top 10 enhancements needed to improve operability.

#### Ruling

The court adopted 10 specific enhancements addressing navigation, personality definitions, state validation, session templates, transcript integrity, error recovery, precedent tracking, metrics, and inter-agent protocols.

#### Rationale

The current infrastructure is comprehensive in rules but incomplete in operability. Users cannot easily navigate, operators lack recovery paths, and the boundary between deliberation and implementation is undefined.

#### Risk Accepted

Enhancement implementation may create temporary inconsistency between documentation and practice. Mitigated by implementing in dependency order.

#### Implications

1. Sets standard for infrastructure review processes
2. Establishes priority framework for enhancements (dependency-aware ordering)
3. Demonstrates unanimous consensus is achievable on operational matters
4. Prophet proposals may be deferred without rejection

#### Key Quotes

> *"The framework assumes good-faith operators. The system trusts. Perhaps that is its greatest vulnerability—and its greatest strength."*  
> — Edward Cullen (Consultant)

> *"The mundane work before the extraordinary."*  
> — MORNINGSTAR::PROPHET (explaining YES vote)

#### Related Precedent

*First formal precedent. No prior cases.*

### 2026-INFRA-002-001: Second Enhancement Deliberation

**Date:** 2026-02-15  
**Feasibility:** F4 (Critical)  
**Vote:** 4-0-0 (Unanimous)  
**Status:** BINDING  
**Tags:** #infrastructure #process #approved #operational  
**Transcript:** [courtroom/transcripts/2026-02-15-second-enhancement-deliberation.md](transcripts/2026-02-15-second-enhancement-deliberation.md)

#### Matter

The court identified and ratified a second slate of 10 enhancements focused on operational excellence, discoverability, and cross-agent coherence (SME failures, dissolution protocol, glossary, precedent citation, OCTAVIUS handoff, onboarding, portal discovery, state backup, runbook, edge-case registry).

#### Ruling

The court adopted all 10 enhancements and delegated implementation to LIL_JEFF (primary) and OCTAVIUS where applicable. Handoff document: courtroom/transcripts/HANDOFF-2026-INFRA-002.md.

#### Rationale

First round delivered infrastructure; this round prioritizes operator experience and reducing memory load (per Consultant). Structural gaps (SME failure tracking, dissolution) closed; handoff matrix (OCTAVIUS) makes the system coherent.

#### Risk Accepted

Implementation touches many files; handoff must be clearly scoped. Mitigated by detailed HANDOFF spec.

#### Implications

1. Establishes second enhancement cycle; confirms pattern from 2026-INFRA-001-001
2. Dissolution Protocol (when not to convene) is now binding guidance
3. docs/ and portal manifest improve discoverability
4. P5 (Dissolution) removed from honorable mention—adopted as Enhancement #2

#### Related Precedent

- 2026-INFRA-001-001: Same enhancement process; first slate

### 2026-ARCH-001-001: Agent Structure (CrewAI-Style Attributes)

**Date:** 2026-02-15  
**Feasibility:** F3  
**Vote:** 4-0-0 (Unanimous)  
**Status:** BINDING  
**Tags:** #architecture #process #approved  
**Transcript:** [courtroom/transcripts/2026-02-15-agent-structure-deliberation.md](transcripts/2026-02-15-agent-structure-deliberation.md)

#### Matter

Whether to add CrewAI-inspired optional attributes (role, goal, backstory, allow_delegation, response_format) to Cursor subagent definitions in `.cursor/agents/*.md`. Runtime-only attributes (max RPM, cache, max iter, etc.) were deemed out of scope.

#### Ruling

Adopt optional frontmatter: `role`, `goal`, optional `backstory`, `allow_delegation`, and optional `response_format`. Add `docs/agent-schema.md`; extend all three agents; add one-line note in inter-agent protocol. Frontmatter is canonical summary; body elaborates.

#### Rationale

Improves clarity, discoverability, and future-proofing without breaking Cursor. Consistency rule mitigates drift between frontmatter and body.

#### Risk Accepted

Minor duplication if maintainers update body but not frontmatter; mitigated by documenting the contract.

#### Implications

- New or updated agents should follow the schema when adding optional fields.
- Template agent and `crew_style` flag deferred to optional follow-up.

#### Related Precedent

*First ARCH precedent.*

## Citation Format

### In Deliberation

When citing precedent during arguments:

```
"The court previously addressed this in [CASE-ID], ruling that [brief ruling].
The rationale was [key reasoning]. I argue this precedent [applies/is distinguishable] 
because [reason]."
```

### In Transcripts

Formal citation in transcript rulings:

```markdown
**Precedent Cited:**
- [CASE-ID] ([Status]): [How it was applied]
```

### In Documentation

Reference format for other documents:

```markdown
See [CASE-ID] in `courtroom/precedents.md` for the ruling on [matter].
```

### Shorthand (Transcripts and Rulings)

Use the Case ID alone or with "Case" prefix. Examples:

- `Per 2026-INFRA-001-001`
- `See Case 2026-INFRA-001-001`
- `2026-INFRA-001-001 (BINDING)`

No need to repeat date or full title in every citation; the precedent index holds the details.

---

## Distinguishing Precedent

### When to Distinguish

Precedent may be distinguished (not followed) when:

- Facts are materially different
- Context has changed significantly
- New information was unavailable at prior ruling
- Technical landscape has evolved

### How to Distinguish

During deliberation:

```
"I acknowledge [CASE-ID] but argue it is distinguishable because:
1. [Material difference 1]
2. [Material difference 2]

Therefore, that precedent should not control this matter."
```

### Recording Distinguished Precedent

In the ruling:

```markdown
**Precedent Distinguished:**
- [CASE-ID]: Distinguished on grounds that [reason]
```

Update this database:

1. Add note to original entry under "Related Precedent"
2. Create new entry with cross-reference

---

## Overruling Precedent

### Requirements to Overrule

Overruling prior precedent requires:

| Requirement | Details |
|-------------|---------|
| **Feasibility** | Must be F4+ deliberation |
| **Explicit motion** | "I move to overrule [CASE-ID]" |
| **Compelling reason** | Prior ruling was wrong, not just different |
| **Vote threshold** | Same as original ruling (typically 3+ YES) |
| **Judge approval** | Judge must endorse overruling rationale |

### Overruling Procedure

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ OVERRULING PROCEDURE                                            │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

1. Motion: "I move to overrule [CASE-ID] because [reason]."

2. Second required from another personality

3. Deliberation focuses on:
   - Why the prior ruling was wrong (not just different)
   - What changed to justify overruling
   - Implications of reversal

4. Vote on motion to overrule

5. If passed:
   - Original entry status → OVERRULED
   - Add reference to overruling case
   - New ruling becomes binding precedent
```

### Recording Overruled Precedent

Update original entry:

```markdown
**Status:** ~~BINDING~~ OVERRULED  
**Overruled by:** [NEW-CASE-ID] on [DATE]  
**Reason:** [Why overruled]
```

Create new entry with:

```markdown
**Precedent Overruled:**
- [OLD-CASE-ID]: Overruled because [reason]
```
